    <h2>PNEUMONIA</h2>
    
    
    <img src="des2.jpg" style="height:200px;"></img>
    <h2>WHAT?</h2>
    <p>Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs. The air sacs may fill with fluid or pus (purulent material), causing cough with phlegm or pus, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing. A variety of organisms, including bacteria, viruses and fungi, can cause pneumonia.</p>
    <h2>Symptoms</h2>
    <p>Most types of pneumonia cause fever, cough with sputum (coughed-up mucus), shortness of breath and fatigue. In older patients, fatigue or confusion can be the only or most noticeable symptom. In viral pneumonia, a dry cough without sputum is more common. 
    </p>
    <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
    <p>Your doctor first will ask about your symptoms. During the physical exam, your doctor will check to see if you are breathing rapidly. He or she also will look for confusion and a purplish hue in your lips, fingernails or hands because these symptoms can indicate that you have low levels of oxygen in your blood. Using a stethoscope, a health care professional can listen through your back for abnormal sounds from the lungs. The diagnosis of pneumonia most often is confirmed by a chest X-ray.</p>
    <img src="dia.jpg" style="height:200px;" style="width: 100px;"></img>
    <h2>Expected Duration</h2>
    <p>How long pneumonia lasts can vary from a few days to a week or longer, depending on how early you start antibiotics and what other medical problems you may have. Antibiotic treatment for pneumonia usually lasts from 5 to 14 days. Many people find that it takes a few weeks to several weeks to regain the level of energy they had before the pneumonia.</p>
    <h2>Prevention</h2>
    <p>Vaccination helps protect at risk people from S. pneumoniae infection. Currently, a 2 vaccine strategy is recommended. The two vaccines are PCV13 (Prevnar) and PPSV23 (Pneumovax) given several months apart. They are recommended for people 65 and older and for people ages 19 to 64 at higher than average risk of developing serious pneumonia. This includes people who smoke and people with: </p>
    <ul>
    <li>lung diesease including asthma</li>
    <li>Heart diesease,liver diesease,kidney disease</li>
    <li>A damaged spleen or no spleen  </li>
    <li>A weakened immune system </li>

</ul>
<h2>Treatment</h2>
<p>The main treatment for pneumonia is one or more antibiotics. A younger or healthier person can be treated safely with antibiotics at home and can feel better in a few days. Some people are at higher risk of complications and may need to be hospitalized for two days to a week. They include people who are older than 60 or have other diseases such as heart failure, active cancer, chronic kidney disease or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  

In addition to antibiotics, other treatments for pneumonia include rest, adequate fluid, and supplemental oxygen to raise the level of oxygen in the blood. </p>
<h2>When To Call a Professional</h2>
<p>A simple cold or bronchitis caused by a virus can share many of the same symptoms as pneumonia. Pneumonia is possible when your cough produces sputum with a green or brown color, you are having shaking chills or you are having trouble breathing. In these cases, you should call your doctor for an urgent evaluation.  

Also, if you have been diagnosed with a cold or bronchitis and symptoms are getting worse or persist after a week, you should call your doctor's office for another evaluation.</p>
